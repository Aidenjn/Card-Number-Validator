# Card-Number-Validator
Reads in a file of card numbers and then outputs them to a file with pass/fail numbers. Outputs 0 if card number is correct length and passes Luhn. Outputs 1 if card number is correct length and does not pass Luhn. Outputs 2 if card number is incorrect length (Luhn does not matter).
